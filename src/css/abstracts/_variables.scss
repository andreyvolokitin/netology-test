/// Variable names may contain a suffix like `bp1213px`. Such suffix means
/// that starting from this breakpoint this variable is applied in the code (inside media queries)
/// instead of a variable with original name (without suffix).
/// I.e. `$my-variable_lte-bp1213px` instead of `$my-variable`.
///
/// `lte-` and `gre-`, in the variable name means "less/greater than, or equal",
/// and describes screen widths for which the variable applies. This depends on the design order
/// (desktop-first, or mobile-first), i.e. the variable changed inside 500px breakpoint should be named:
/// - "lte-bp950px" for desktop-first (@media screen and (max-width: 500px));
/// - "gte-bp950px" for mobile-first (@media screen and (min-width: 500px)).

/// Breakpoints map. Values are content-based and sorted in design order
/// (desktop-first, or mobile-first).
///
/// Due to a large amount of breakpoints it is impossible to give all
/// of them meaningful names. Instead breakpoints are named with the
/// breakpoint value prefixed with a "bp", i.e. "bp1280px". Breakpoint values
/// are used in the code via `bp()` function like so:
/// `@media screen and (max-width: bp(bp1110px))`.
///
/// To refactor a breakpoint you should change its value and then use a global
/// "Find and replace" search in the IDE/code editor to search and edit breakpoint name
/// (i.e. search `bp1213px` and change it to `bp1300px`). This will also affect
/// global variable names, because they may contain a suffix like `bp1213px`
/// which also should be edited. Such suffix means that starting from this breakpoint
/// this variable is applied in the code (inside media queries) instead of a variable
/// with original name (without suffix). I.e. `$my-variable_lte-bp1213px` instead of `$my-variable`.
///
/// `lte-` and `gte-`, in the variable name means "less/greater than, or equal",
/// and describes screen widths for which the variable applies. This depends on the design order
/// (desktop-first, or mobile-first), i.e. the variable changed inside 500px breakpoint should be named:
/// - "lte-bp950px" for desktop-first (@media screen and (max-width: 500px));
/// - "gte-bp950px" for mobile-first (@media screen and (min-width: 500px)).
///
/// This mechanism should not be abused because it has limited applicability â€” it works only for
/// simple media queries like single max/min-width. Ranges or combined queries are not supported.
